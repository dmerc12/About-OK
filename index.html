                Oklahoma is in the southern central plains of the United States, bordering Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri.
                Admitted to statehood in 1907, it presently has a population of 3,959,353 people.
                Some cities in Oklahoma include Oklahoma City (or OKC), Tulsa, and Norman.
                The capital of Oklahoma City is home to the NBA team Thunder, which helped earn the nickname "Loud City."
                Tulsa has many oil fields, which significantly assisted in developing the nickname "Oil Capital of the World."
                Finally, Norman is home to the University of Oklahoma, where it gets its nickname "Home of the Sooners."
            </p>
            <h2>Pre-19<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                Indigenous people have been present in present-day Oklahoma since the last ice age.
                The original tribes were the ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, Tonkawa, and Caddo tribes.
                A monument from the original tribes that is present today is in Spiro called Spiro Mounds, which flourished with activity between AD 850 and 1450.
                The Plains Apache tribes settled in the Southern Plains, including modern Oklahoma, between 1300 and 1500.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                The Spanish conquistador Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado traveled through what is now Oklahoma in 1541 but was claimed by the French in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century.
                By that point, the Comanche, Kiowa, Quapaw, and Osage tribes had moved into the western and eastern regions of the area.
                After the Louisiana Purchase, the land that would become Oklahoma was transferred to the US government and was a part of the Arkansas Territory between 1819 and 1828.
            </p>
            <h2>Post-19<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, many American Indian tribes were relocated forcibly from their native lands east of the Mississippi River to the region that now includes modern Oklahoma.
                These relocations often included enslaved individuals. 
                The phrase "Trail of Tears" was formerly used to describe the Choctaw nation's forced migration but has since been associated with the Cherokee nation's experience. 
                Following the arrival of these tribes, the area was called the Choctaw Nation before being renamed Indian Territory or Indian Country. 
                By 1890, over 30 Native American tribes had been confined to the lands within this territory.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                During the American Civil War, all Five Civilized Tribes entered treaties with the Confederate military.
                During this period, the Cherokee Nation experienced an internal civil war. The abolition of slavery in Indian Territory occurred in 1866, a year after the Civil War ended.
                Between 1866 and 1899, cattle trails and ranches expanded as Texas ranchers and cowboys met the demand for food in eastern cities by driving their cattle north or illegally settling in Indian Territory.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                From 1887 to 1895, land runs were held in Indian Territory, opening former tribal lands acquired by the United States government under the Dawes Act and Curtis Act.
                This era saw the emergence of the term "sooner," which referred to settlers who illegally crossed the border before the official opening time and eventually became the state's official nickname.
                As a result of these land runs, portions of Indian Territory became known as Oklahoma Territory.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                In 1905, the Sequoyah Statehood Convention occurred. 
                It was an attempt to create an all-Indian state, initially proposed to be called Oklahoma and later Sequoyah, but these efforts were unsuccessful. 
                Two years later, President Theodore Roosevelt issued Presidential Proclamation No. 780 in 1907, officially admitting Oklahoma as the 46<sup>th</sup> state.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                During the early 20th century, the burgeoning oil industry brought rapid wealth and population growth to towns across Oklahoma.
                This boom played a significant role in the early economy, earning Tulsa the nickname "Oil Capital of the World."
