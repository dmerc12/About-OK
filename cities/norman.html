                Norman is the third-most populous city in Oklahoma and the second-largest within the Oklahoma City metropolitan area after the state capital. 
                The town was founded during the Land Run of 1889 and named after Abner Norman, the original land surveyor. 
                As of the 2020 census, Norman has a population of 128,026.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                As the home of the University of Oklahoma, the state's largest university, Norman is a hub for higher education and research. 
                The university hosts several museums, including one that boasts the most extensive collection of French Impressionist art held by an American university.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Located within Tornado Alley, Norman is also home to the National Weather Center (NWC) and the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). 
                Operating from the NWC, the SPC forecasts for severe and high-impact hazardous weather across the contiguous United States. 
                Within the NWC, the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) researches experimental weather technologies for enhancing severe weather warnings and forecasts.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                The area that would become Oklahoma came into the United States with the Louisiana Purchase.
                Before the American Civil War, the federal government began relocation efforts for the Five Civilized Tribes.
                Two treaties in 1832 and 1833 assigned the region that would become Norman to the Creek Nation.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                After the Civil War conclusion, as a result of the Creeks aiding the Confederacy, the region was ceded back to the United States in 1866.
                During the early 1870s, the federal government began surveying these unassigned lands taken back by the government.
                A 23-year-old surveyor from Kentucky named Abner Ernest Norman set up camp in what would become Norman during this surveying effort.
                The men from her work camp carved a sign into an elm tree that read "Norman's Camp" in honor of their boss.
                Later, the land opened for settlement in the Land Run of 1889.
                These early settlers decided to keep the name "Norman."
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Not long after founding the city, two prominent businessmen, Delbert Larsh, and Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university within the newly founded city.
                The two men intended to grow the city.
                One idea to do this would have been to secure the location of the heavily congested territory capital.
                Instead, they decided to secure the location of the state's first university.
                They were successful on December 19, 1890, roughly 18 years before the state would gain statehood.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Early Norman was a sundown town, not allowing African American residents until the early 1960s.
                This discrimination included staying overnight and studying at the University of Oklahoma.
                In 2020, the city council formally addressed this issue, issuing an apology.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                By 1913, the population of Norman had grown to over 3,700.
                The extension of the Oklahoma Railway Company's interurban streetcar line from Oklahoma City through Moore to Norman contributed to this growth.
                As the U.S. Numbered Highway system emerged in the 1940s, the purpose of the rails changed to freight transport.
                By 1940, Norman's population had increased to 11,429.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Interstate 35 was completed in June 1959, assisting the city in finding its role as a bedroom community in Oklahoma City.
                In 1960, the city population was 33,412, but by 1970 the population had grown to 52,117.
                During this time, the city's land area increased by 174 square miles.
                With the population reaching 95,694 in 2000, 110,925 in 2010, and 128,026 in 2020, this growth trend has continued into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
