                Oklahoma City, "Loud City," earned this vibrant nickname from its passionate sports fans, particularly those
                supporting the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder.
                The term embodies the energy and enthusiasm of the city's residents, whose loud and unwavering support has made the
                Chesapeake Energy Arena one of the most electrifying atmospheres in professional basketball.
                This dynamic spirit reflects the broader sense of pride and community felt throughout the city.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p class="indented">
                The area that would become Oklahoma City opened for a land run event on April 22, 1889.
                Four days later, William Couch became the first mayor.
                Initially, the area contained 10,000 homesteaders, but it quickly grew. 
                Between 1890 and 1900, the population doubled.
                Founders of the city included Anton H. Classen, John Wilford Shartel, Henry Overholser, Oscar Ameringer, Jack C. Walton, Angelo C. Scott, and James W. Maney.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                In 1907, Oklahoma joined the Union as the 46th state. 
                The city population had already overtaken Guthrie, the territorial capital, setting the stage to become the new state commercial hub and capital.
                Before World War II, the city became a significant economic center, drawing jobs and resources away from larger cities like Chicago and Omaha, specifically through its prominent stockyards.
                The discovery of oil within city limits in 1928 transformed Oklahoma City into a vital player in the oil industry.
                Following World War II, the development of the Interstate Highway System, with I-35, I-40, and I-44 converging in the city, contributed substantially to its post-war growth.
                Establishing Tinker Air Force Base also played a crucial role in this expansion.
                By 1959, the city initiated efforts to grow its territory, expanding from 80 square miles to 475.55 square miles by 1961, making it the largest city in the country by land area.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                Oklahoma City elected the first woman to serve as mayor of a city within the United States with a population exceeding 350,000 in 1971 when Patience Latting became the city's first female mayor.
                During the 1970s and 1980s, a population decline occurred throughout many American cities, Oklahoma City included.
                Due to this decline and many projects that failed to spark new development, the city lost many architecturally significant buildings to clearances, such as the Criterion Theater, the Baum Building, the Hales Building, and the Biltmore Hotel.
                These clearances left many vacant lots that are used now for parking.
                A notable exception to these projects is the construction of the Myriad Gardens and Crystal Bridge, a botanical garden in the downtown area.
            </p>
            <p class="indented">
                A redevelopment package known as the Metropolitan Area Projects, or MAPS, was passed in 1993 to establish more activities and life downtown.
                During this redevelopment, the city built a new baseball park, library, convention center, fairgrounds, a water canal through the Bricktown entertainment district, and renovations to the civic center.
                This result of MAPS was a resounding success and left exponential growth in the housing population downtown, leaving demand for other amenities and stores to spur even more growth.
                Since the completion of the MAPS projects, the downtown development has continued.

                The bombing on April 19, 1995, in front of the Murrah building left the city scarred and left 168 people killed.
                This terrorist event left the building only partially destroyed and severely damaged 100 nearby buildings.
                The site has since been designated as a memorial and museum to honor the bombing and those lost.
                On the bombing anniversary every year, survivors, families, and friends return to the memorial for a reading of the names lost that day.
                Since opening in 2000, over three million people have visited.
